**Source:** various sources

## Ingredients

- 1 bottle (750ml) of red wine (find something that's ready to drink, not too acidic. Syrah/Shiraz is nice)
- 1-2 tablespoon sugar/honey of any kind (can add more at the end if not sweet enough)
- 6 juniper berries
- 1-2 sticks of cinnamon
- 3 cloves
- 1-2 star anise
- 1 juicy orange

## Tools
- 1 pot that'll hold all the liquid
- 1 lid to cover the pot
- (optional) A rice cooker to keep the liquid warm when serving



## Instructions

1. Dump in the spices & sugar into the pot
2. Wash and then cut the orange in half
3. Squeeze the orange juice into the pot
4. Cut up the orange into small-medium sized chunks that'll submerge in the liquid
5. Pour in the bottle of red wine, put the lid on
6. Bring the pot of liquid into a simmer on low-medium heat (DO NOT make it boil, otherwise too much of the alcohol will evaporate)
7. Keep simmering for about 15 minutes
8. Taste and see if you need to add more sugar/honey
8. Store the pot overnight in a fridge to let the spices steep, or/and then transfer to a rice cooker on "keep warm" when serving
