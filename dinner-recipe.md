## Martin's dinner recipe
### cordon bleu en croute: 
- chicken breast (?) --> slice in half
- (maybe some salt & pepper to flavour it)
- pound it flat
- layer on some ham & cheese, and sage (because it goes well with chicken)
- roll it up 
- place on choux pastry & roll it up
- put in oven, 200 degrees (can cut it in half to see if cooked, or if cheese melted then probably cooked)
- around 20-25 minutes?

### bacon and green beens: 
- dump cold bacon (lardon fum√© into cold pan)
- turn on high heat 
- let cook for a bit (grease comes out)
- put green beans in
- stir it till bacon looks crispy

### polenta:
- pour polenta (250 grams for 3-4 people) into pot (mid-high heat)
- milk (add as necessary - depend on desired liquidity)
- stir and taste test if cooked (not crunchy) 
- when almost cooked, add grated parmesan
- salt & pepper

### meringue, double cream, and berries: 
- meringue (the swiss kind where they add sugar so it's sweet) 
- dollop of double cream
- sprinkle berries on top
