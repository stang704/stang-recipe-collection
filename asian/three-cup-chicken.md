## Ingredients

**Serves:** two portions

- two chicken thighs (boneless for the lazy peeps, else you can choose to keep the bones or debone it when cooking)
- 1-2 red chili peppers (or 1 red 1 green doesn't matter), if small chilis then 2 for sure, can always dial down if you like no spice. Can be dried ones if you don't have fresh ones
- 6 cloves of garlic
- 30-40g of fresh basil leaves
- 30-40g of thinly sliced ginger
- 30ml rice wine
- 30ml sesame oil
- 30ml soy sauce (or half that + half oyster sauce for extra umami)
- 1/2 tbs of sugar (white sugar, palm sugar, brown sugar, whatever, eyeball it)
- 30ml water (might not use it all up)


## Tools

- 1 wok
- 1 砂鍋 with a lid (optional)
- 1 pan (if you need to sear your chicken first)
- 1 boning knife if you need to de-bone your chicken thighs

## Instructions

### Prep the ingredients

1. Slice up the chili peppers diagonally (see ref 1)
2. Slice up the ginger into thin slices
3. Peel the garlic and smash 'em (ref 1)

### What to do with the chicken

There's not really a wrong way to handle the chicken, as long as you don't cut it into too-small pieces. You can 川燙 the chicken, you can pan sear it, you can marinate the chicken a bit first.

#### If you like boneless chicken in the dish:

Use boneless chicken thighs, otherwise just look up any video on how to debone a chicken thigh. Once you've got your flat chicken thigh laid out on the chopping board, score them in a grid-like manner (about 1-2 cm each cut), this is to break any tricky tendons that may still remain.

**Pan sear:**
- Then heat up some oil in a pan, mid-low heat, place the whole chicken thigh - skin down, let it sear, as if you're about to cook a chicken steak. 
- After the skin turns golden, flip the chicken thigh and cook the other side. Cook it till about 80% done.
- Bring it back to the chopping board and chop up the chicken thigh into 2-3cm chunks. Tiny pieces don't work well for this dish. You want it to be hearty. Set them aside for later.

#### If you don't care for bone in chicke:

Good thing about keeping the bone on is that the bones help add the chicken flavour to the dish.

- Get one of those big knives, or a Chinese chopping knife if you have, and chop up the chicken thighs into 2-3cm chunks.

**川燙:**
- Throw the chicken chunks in a pot, top with cold water, 2-3 slices of ginger, dash of rice wine, and bring to boil
- As soon as the water boils, scoop up the chicken and run them under cold water to clean them off properly. Pat 'em dry.
- You're gonna have to brown the skin in the wok later.

**Marinate:**
- Wash the chicken chunks under cold water until the water is clear
- Marinate with some salt, 5 or 13 spice powder (the kind for Chinese cooking), dash or two of shaoxing/yellow/rice wine, dash or two of soy sauce, white pepper.
- Let side for 30min - 1hr

### Cooking time!

Cooking order: sesame oil > rice wine > soy sauce

1. Wok on stove, low heat, pour half the sesame oil, dump in the ginger slices, cook till golden and slightly crispy
   - Gotta be cold wok to start with, other wise the ginger gets bitter fast
2. Dump in the smashed garlic, go in with the second half of your sesame oil
   - if you have fresh chili peppers, you can dump them in now, if dried ones, dump them in later. There doesn't seem to be significant differences in the order.
3. Give it time to heat up
4. Once it's starting to be fragrant, dump in your chicken chunks & sliced up chili peppers
5. Bring wok to mid-high heat, cook till chicken takes on an amber golden colour
6. Sprinkle in the sugar
7. Pour in the rice wine, stir & mix
8. Pour in the soy sauce, add in some water if too dry, bring to boil

Now if you have the 砂鍋, transfer the whole thing over, if not, keep cooking in the original wok.

9. Mid-high heat, cover with lid, let it keep cooking until the sauce reduces into a thick gravy-like consistency. If you're cooking it Taiwanese style, you basically want it to be almost dry
10. Turn to low heat (or turn off the heat if you're in the 砂鍋), dump in the fresh basil leaveas, mix it a bit, put the lid back on and let the heat cook the basil leaves for about 30 seconds
11. Take off the lid, give it a stir, 

## How to serve

If you want some pretty pictures for the 'gram, place a sprig of basil leaves to put on top of the whole pot.
To eat - serve over a steaming bowl of rice. You can throw in another side dish of some green veggies.
