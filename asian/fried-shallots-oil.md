## Ingredients

Makes about 150g of fried shallots. 
Takes about 45 minutes

- 紅蔥頭 5-6 顆
- 植物油 cooking/frying oil (ratio to your shallots is about 1:1)
- sprinkle of salt

**Optional:**
- 豬油 lard 1-2 tbs 

## Tools
- 1 small/medium-sized pot that can hold your shallots + oil
- 1 bowl to contain the oil
- 1 strainer to catch the fried shallots
- 1 plate to lay out and dry your fried shallots
- kitchen towel
- 2 containers/jars to hold 
  - your crispy fried shallots
  - and your shallot oil

## Instructions

1. Peel and slice up your shallots.
2. Dump everything in the pot (should be cold/room temperature). 
3. Pour oil over the shallots till it comfortably covers the shallots. Throw in the lard if you have it.
4. Turn the stove on low-medium heat.
5. Give it a stir every now and then to ensure that the heat is evenly distributed. Let the oil continue bubbling
6. When the shallots start looking like they've just turned pale golden, turn off the heat and strain the oil into the bowl. You have a pretty short window before the shallots start turning into char so you'll need to watch this carefully. 
7. Lay out a piece of kitchen towel over a plate and then dump the fried shallots over it. Gently spread it out evenly with a fork or something and let the kitchen towel soak up the excess oil.
