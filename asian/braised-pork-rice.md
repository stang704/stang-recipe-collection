#爌肉販 | Taiwanese braised pork over rice

The goal is that the meat should be a good ratio of lean & fat, and the texture should come out so soft and tender that when you bite down, it almost melts.

## Instructions

### Prep the ingredients

1. Cut the chili peppers into 3-4cm segments
2. Slice up the ginger into thin slices
3. Peel the garlic and lightly smash 'em
4. Cut the spring onions into 5-6cm segments
5. Cut the meat into chunks - 2-2cm thick, about 4-5cm wide (like 2/3 of your fingers wide but thicker)
6. Put two tooth picks into either side of the chunks to hold them together (see video)

If you also have eggs:
1. Boil water in a separate pot, put in the eggs, cook for 10 minutes
2. Turn off the heat, run eggs through cold water
3. give it 20 minutes (change water if still too hot) --> you can do this while you cook the meat
4. Peel the eggs and set it aside for later

### Cooking time!

1. Cold pan, some oil to coat the bottom of the pan, low heat
2. Put the slices of meat into the pan, sear till golden with crispy edges
3. Flip onto the other side and repeat
4. Once both sides take on the golden colour and crispy edges, transfer the meat into the pot
5. Sprinkle in the sugar, still low heat, let the sugar melt
6. Flip the meat to coat both sides with the melted sugar
7. Keep cooking, you'll now see the sugar coating, making the meat glisten
8. Pour in 4 tablespoons of soy sauce and add the honey (optinal)
9. Cook for 2 more minutes, let the meat soak in the colour of the soy sauce
10. Once you see the colour, dump in the spring onions, ginger, garlic, chili peppers, and teaspoon of salt
11. Pour in 2 tablespoons of shaoxing wine (or rice wine), let it reach start to boil
12. Dump in your 滷包 (the spices in a packet) + 400ml of water
13. Bring the pot to a boil
14. Put a lid on, cook for 1-5 hours on lowest heat setting
15. Check in at the 1 hour mark, see how your meat is doing, check if the fat is slightly wiggling
16. Keep cooking for another hour, at the end of the 2-hours, the fat will have also melted into the sauce

## How to serve

Pick out 2-3 pieces of meat (depending on size), remove the tooth picks, and lay them over some rice. Ladle some sauce from the pot and pour over the rice. Scoop up an egg, slice it in half (longitudinally), and place them alongside the rice. 

Optional: Slice up some coriander and sprinkle some on top of the meat, add in a side of lightly pickled cucumber.

Well to be fair, everything is optional.
