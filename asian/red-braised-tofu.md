## Ingredients

**Serves:** 2-3 portions

- 蛋豆腐 2盒 tofu 2 blocks (softer ones, but no worries if you find medium or firm tofu)
- 大蒜 5瓣 garlic 5 cloves
- 青蔥 2枝 spring onions 2 sticks/sprigs
- 糖 1小匙 sugar 1 teaspoon (but I like 2 tsps)
- 醬油 1大匙 soy sauce 1 tablespoon (can be 2)
- 蠔油 1大匙 oyster sauce 1 tablespoon
- 米酒 0.5大匙 rice wine 0.5 tablespoon
- 水(高湯) 50ml water 50ml (or more, you just cook it a bit longer to reduce
- cooking oil
- shake of white pepper (optional)

## Tools

- 1 pan/wok where you can fit all the sliced up tofu on one layer 
- 1 spatula 

## Instructions

### Prep the ingredients

1. Slice up the spring onions into 0.5cm thick segments, separate the white/pale part with the dark green part. First half for cooking, second half for garnish
2. Peel and lightly smash the garlic
3. Slice up the tofu into 1cm thick segments of 1 inch by 1 inch (doesn't hurt if it's rectangular instead of square)

### Cook in this particular order

1. Put in a good amount of oil in your wok, put on medium heat (and keep it at this level through out the entire process)
2. Once the oil is heated, put in the slices of tofu, let it fry on one side. Shake wok in circular motion gently every now and then. Roughly 2 minutes or until the side is golden
3. Flip the tofu slices, same process
4. When the other side is almost golden, dump in the garlic and spring onions and let them fry till fragrant (爆香)
5. Dump in the sugar, let it melt into the oil and coat all the tofu
6. Pour in the soy sauce from around the sides of the wok
7. Pour in the oyster, same manner, mix a bit
8. Pour in the rice wine, same manner, mix a bit
9. (optional) shake in some white pepper
10. Pour in the water, let it cook and reduce till the sauce has a watery gravy consistency

## Cooking notes
- keep pan on medium heat, you want the tofu to crisp up before it dries out in the middle
- pour in the sauces against the sides of the pan so it briefly burns before hitting the food, then you add water last to get all the residue into the dish
- there should be some sauce left in the dish to drizzle over the tofu and rice
