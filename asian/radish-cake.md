## Instructions

### Cook the radish

1. Measure out the salt, sugar, white pepper, and water separately
2. Peel and grate the white radish, weigh you radish to figure out how much you have
3. Put the radish in the pot, add in the salt, sugar, water. Leave white pepper aside
4. Boil the radish, once it comes to a boil, turn to low heat and simmer with lid on for 10 minutes

### The batter

1. Measure out the rice flour and tapioca starch in 1 bowl (weight would be according to how much grated radish you have
2. Pour the water over the flour
3. Mix with a whisk until smooth liquid consistency and there are no chunks of flour

#### Optional ingredients

1. finely dice up the mushrooms, shrimps
2. fry till fragrant on a pan
3. add to batter mixture
4. add in the fried shallots
5. Mix everything well

### Cooking the batter

1. Get your spatula ready to stir very quickly
2. Get your container ready on the side
3. Verify that the radish is translucent (if not, keep cooking the radish till it is)
4. Add in the white pepper and mix
5. Pour the batter into the radish that you've been cooking
6. Stir quickly and constantly so the botton doesn't congeal and/or burn
7. Once you reach a thick and goopy (not liquidy) consistency, turn heat off and pour batter into container
8. Scrape the pot clean with a spatula and flatten the batter in the container

### Steam the cake

1. If in a rice cooker - pout in 4 (rice cooker) cups of water and let it cook, once done, let it sit inside for 15 more minutes
2. If steaming on a stove top - bring water to boil, steam at medium heat for 45 minutes, then turn heat off and let it sit for 15 minutes.
3. To check if done, poke a chopstick or knife into the cake, if it comes out relatively clean (not caramelly sticky), then it's done cooking
4. Let it cool for 3-4 hours to set and then put in fridge. Best to leave overnight before cooking but you can also just cook it after you cool it. 

## How to serve

Slice up the cake into 1.5 cm thick rectangular slices, about 1/2 a palm size. 
Heat up some oil on a pan and pan fry them till golden crispy on both sides. Dip in some soy sauce mixed with finely minced garlic (or pour over the cakes)
Or you can steam them, serve with the same sauce; or cook them in savoury soup.
