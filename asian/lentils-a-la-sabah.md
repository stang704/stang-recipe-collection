### Utensils (for reference only)
(!) make sure to use a wooden spoon or some spatula that you don't mind being stained
- you need a small bowl for gathering the spices
- a big pot for cooking everything together


## Instructions

### REQUIRED PREP

(!) make sure to soak the lentils (like a day or so), otherwise the lentils won't be soft. They're super 

### Actual cooking
1. combine the masala in a small bowl - simplest is just to do 1:1:1 of everything; 1-2 bay leaves
2. heat up the wok/pot till water droplets dance
3. add in your oil/ghee
4. throw in and roast the masala --> roast the spices in oil (ghee or just neutral oil) till fragrant
5. add water (like 1 litre?), start with smaller quantity, you can always add more later
6. strain the lentils and dump them into the pot
7. cook till soft
8. add some salt
9. you can throw in peas and potatoes in the mean time and get it to soften.
10. if needed, add more water, or don't, depending on how thick/watery you like it to be
11. add more salt if needed (if too salty, definitely throw in the potatoes and/or add water)
12. once everything is soft enough to personal preference, you're done

## Plating
1. scoop the lentils into a bowl
2. you can serve with rice or bread
3. optionally, finely chop coriander and sprinkle however much you like on top
