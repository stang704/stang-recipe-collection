## Ingredients
roughly serves 4

- silken tofu, around 450g?
  - if you don't have silken tofu, medium firm tofu can be used instead
- 豬絞肉 50公克
- 蔥 2根
- 蒜末 1小匙
- 薑末 1小匙
- 花椒 roughly 1/2 table spoon? (optional)
  - if you don't have whole pepper corns, you can also use the pre-ground ones
- 辣豆瓣醬 2大匙
- 豆鼓 1 table spoon (optional)
- 醬油 2匙
- oil 3-4 tbs (or enough for the ground pork)
- 糖 1 tea spoon
- 水 1/4 - 1/2碗
- 太白粉水 30ml (optional)
- 香油 1匙
- rice wine/yellow wine 2 tbs


## Tools

- 1 wok 
- 1 pot
- some bowls for your aromatics
- a big bowl or soup plate to serve


## Instructions

### Mise en place

1. Toast the sichuan pepper corns on low heat (do it slowly)
2. Once it's fragrant, set it aside to cool
3. Boil water (for the tofu), add a teaspoon of salt
4. Dice up the tofu into 1.5cm cubes, dump into the boiling water
  - according to the video, the purpose is to remove the strong tofu smell and solidify the protein so that it doesn't break as easily when you cook it in the dish. Especially important for silken tofu
5. Put the broad bean paste onto a chopping board and chop it up finely (so the flavour comes out)
6. Then on the same board, dump the 豆鼓 on top of the paste and chop that up too. Scoop the paste into a bowl, set aside
7. Go back to the pepper corns and crush/ground/blend finely, and then sift out the shells/husks 
8. Cut up the white part of the spring onion into 2-inch segments
9. Further thinly julienne the segments, and then finly dice into bruinoise-size squares
10. Finely mince the garlic and ginger
11. Chop up the green part of the spring onion and set aside in another bowl

### The cooking

1. Wok on stove, medium-high heat, dump in the oil
2. Dump in the minced pork and get it fragrant
3. Dump in the broad bean paste and get it fragrant (the oil from the paste should come out)
4. Dump in the garlic, ginger, white part of the spring onions
  - according to the video, the purpose is to cool down the wok a bit, and also bring the flavour out of these aromatics through heat
5. Once everything is fragrant, dump in 3/4 the grounded sichuan pepper corn and get it fragrant
6. Pour in the rice wine/yellow wine
7. Pour in the soy sauce, mix well
8. Pour in the water, mix well
9. Dump in the sugar, mix well
10. Dump in the tofu, use gentle pushing motions to mix the tofu into the sauce
11. Let it simmer for a while
12. Now we 勾芡 (and reduce the sauce a bit), turn down to medium heat 
  - do it in small amounts each time, up to 3 times. Each time pour in a circular motion, and mix in gentle circular motions
13. Throw in half to 3/4 of the green part of the spring onions, mix a bit
14. Pour that onto the plate/bowl
15. Sprinkle on the rest of the spring onions and the ground sichuan pepper corn for plating
