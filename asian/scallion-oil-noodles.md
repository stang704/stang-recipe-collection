# 蔥油拌麵 | Scallion Oil Noodles

According to the youtube video (linked below), this is a Shanghainese dish, which is typically characterised by oil and dark sauces (濃油赤醬). It's simple and filling, great for a simple birthday (because noodles), or a quick lunch, I guess.

## Ingredients

For the noodles - use whatever you like/have.

### 蔥油 | the scallion oil

- 青蔥 1 把 (約 150-200g) whole scallions 1 bunch
- 植物油 cooking/frying oil 約 250g (if adding 50g of lard), or 300g (if no lard)

**Optional:**
- 豬油 lard 1-2 tbs (makes it more fragrant)

### 甘甜醬油 | the sweet soy sauce
- 醬油 100g
- 冰糖 40-45g (regular sugar, cane sugar, whatever)
  - obviously adjust amount depending on how sweet you like the sauce. 

## Tools

- 1 medium-sized pot that can hold your scallions + oil
- 1 bowl to contain the oil
- 1 strainer to catch the fried scallions
- 1 plate to lay out and dry your fried scallions
- kitchen towel
- Containers to hold your scallion oil and sweet soy sauce

## Instructions - scallion oil

This will take about 45 minutes. Exact amount of time required to fry it depends on how much water content is in the scallions. More water content = more frying time. 

1. Wash the stalks of the scallions, wipe it completely dry (to avoid oil interacting with the water droplets when you fry them)
2. Chop up the scallions into abotu 2-inch segments (separated into the white part and the deeper green part). You might usually have 3 sections - 1 white, 2 green.
3. Pour in the oil (and lard), turn stove on low heat, get the lard to melt. 

**Fry the white part of the scallion stalks first**
5. Dump in the white segments of the scallion stalks you've just cut. 
6. Let it slowly fry, until the edges start to start to slowly turn golden (邊邊開始微微的金黃上色), and keep going.
7. Keep it frying until the colours thoroughly reach a golden tone. 
8. PICK/SCOOP the fried scallions up from the pot. You still need the oil for the green parts of the scallions.
9. Put on plate with kitchen towel to absorb the excess grease.

**Then fry the green parts**
10. Dump in the green parts of the scallions.
11. Repeat the steps until the colour turns dark green like kale (墨綠色)
12. You can pick up the fried scallions and put it on the plate with the kitchen towel.
13. Or strain over a bowl/container to catch the oil and then put the fried scallions on the plate. 

## Instructions - sweet soy sauce
1. In the same pot you just used to fry the scallions, pour in your soy sauce & sugar.
2. Turn on high heat and cook until the sugar melts.
3. When the sauce bubbles big time, turn off the heat.
4. At this point you can taste and see if you want to adjust the sweetness. 

## How to serve

Obviously, cook the noodles.

1. While the noodles are cooking, put 1-2 tablespoons of scallion oil + same amount of sweet soy sauce in a bowl.
2. When the noodles are just about down, add 1 tablespoon of noodle water (like pasta water!) into the bowl.
3. When the noodles are done, pick up the noodles from the pot, (if you like, you can run them through ice cold water for 5 seconds), and dump them into the bowl, over the sauce.

**Garnishes & optional seasoning**
5. Place in some of the fried scallions over the noodles (and sprinkle in some 蔥花 if you like).
6. You can also add in a teaspoon or two of dark vinegar (烏醋).
7. Serve as is. Mix thoroughly before you eat.
