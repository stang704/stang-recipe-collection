**Source:** [Vincenzo's Plate][1]

**Important:** 
- Remember that the Bolognese is a meat-based sauce, not a tomato-based sauce. 
- Original recipe used a blender to blend the ingredients. Did not have a blender so chopped everything finely.
- Important to use pancetta, otherwise guanciale. If none are available, then last resort: lardon/bacon.

## Recommended types of pasta
Flat, egg pastas - egg pasta for absorbing the sauce, and the flat surface to grab the sauce better
- Pappardelle
- Tagliatelle
- Fettucine


## Ingredients

- 1 x brown onion
- 1 x celery stalk
- 1 x carrot
- 150g pancetta
- 700g ground/minced pork
- 500ml tomato/basil sugo, or tomato passata
- Extra virgin olive oil
- 1 x glass white/red wine
- 1 - 2 x glasses water
- Salt and pepper

**Optional but definitely good to add**
- dried herbs (e.g. oregano)
- basil leaves (ripped up into pieces)

**I also used**
- 1 x green bell pepper
- 1 x can of diced tomatoes in place of some tomato passata

### Utensils (for reference only)
- Sharp knife
- Chopping board
- Hand blender (if you don't have, then chop all ingredients finely by hand)
- 2 x Medium to large size pot (one for sauce, one for pasta)
- Pan for mixing the pasta
- Wooden spoon
- Tongs 
- Large serving spoon

## Instructions
### Sauce part I - soffrito
Bolognese sauce starts with a delicious foundation – soffrito with a twist!
**If you have a blender**
1. Start by roughly chopping the carrot, onion and celery, and cutting the pancetta into strips.
2. Mix all chopped up ingredients together and combine well using a hand blender.

**If you don't have a blender**
1. Cutting the pancetta into small strips.
2. Put pancetta in one of the large pots on low to medium heat (depends on your stove) and let the grease slowly come out.
3. Add 4-5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)
4. Chop the onion, celery, carrot, and bell pepper (if you're using it) into find dices (bruinoise)
   - stall the cooking on the pancetta if it's cooking faster than your chopping


5. When 4) is warm enough, mix all chopped up ingredients and dump in that pot with the pancetta, combine using a wooden spoon.
6. Leave the soffrito to simmer for around 10 minutes.

### Sauce part II
7. Add the minced pork to your Bolognese sauce mix, breaking down the chunks of meat (as finely as possible) using a wooden spoon as you cook it.
8. Once you have some colour on the minced meat, you can sprinkle a generous amount of salt along with dried oregano (or an alternate herb of your choice).
9. Add glass of white/red wine.
10. Leave the Bolognese sauce to simmer for approx. 5 minutes(?), stirring every so often. This should start to bubble as the wine evaporates.
11. Now it’s time to add the bottle of passata/tomato sauce and a sprinkle of pepper before continuing to mix once again.
12. The final ingredient is 1 x glass of water. Add this to your Bolognese sauce, mix through and cover, leaving it to cook for 30 minutes.
   - the lid seals in the moisture so the meat can cook and still be nice and moist
13. Stir the sauce every 10 minutes so the meat cooks evenly and nothing sticks to the pan.
14. Once 30  minutes have passed, uncover and mix well using a wooden spoon.

VINCENZO’S PLATE TIP: If there is not a lot of moisture in the pan, add one more glass of water to your mixture and bring the cooking temperature down slightly as you want the Bolognese sauce to remain nice and moist.

15. At this point if there are any thick chunks of meat, break them down again using your wooden spoon before leaving the sauce to simmer once more for 30 minutes with the lid off, stirring every ten minutes or so. 
   - you should notice that over the 30 minutes of open lid, the sauce has reduced by a noticeable amount (about 2cm?)

### Cook the pasta
16. In the meantime (or when there's about 5 minutes left), boil enough water in a second pot and add a tablespoon of rock salt, leaving it to dissolve.
17. Once the sauce has finished cooking and your water has boiled, add your choice of pasta to the water and cook according to the packet instructions.
18. While the pasta is boiling, prepare a large fry pan for mixing!
19. Place a frypan on the stove at a low heat, and add a generous serving-spoonful (or two!) of Bolognese sauce, covering the base.
20. When there's 1-2 minutes left on the pasta, add one or two serving-spoonful of pasta water to the pan with the Bolognese sauce and mix.
20. Next, add the strained pasta into the pan and mix through until the pasta is completely lathered before adding another generous amount of Bolognese sauce and mixing again.
