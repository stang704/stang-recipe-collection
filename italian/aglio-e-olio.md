## Ingredients

**Serves:** 2 people/portions/meals

- 5-6 tablespoons of olive oil (for 2 people)
- 2 cloves of garlic (1 clove per person)
- 300g/10.5oz pasta (you'd usually use spaghetti)
- salt


**Optional, good to have**
- fresh bunch of parsley
- chilli flakes

### Utensils (for reference only)

- Large pot
- Stainless steel pan
- Wooden spoon
- Knife
- Tongs

## Instructions

1. Peel the garlic and thinly slice them up. Then cut across them into tiny strips.
2. Finely chop up the parsley stalks (it contains flavours and you want to use those!).
3. Finely chop up the pasley leaves, keep aside.
4. On the side, start cooking the pasta (till about 1 minute left)
5. Put pan on low-medium heat, pour in the olive oil (5-6 tablespoons for 2 people)
6. Dump the garlic into the pan, stir it a bit to evenly distribute it in the pan.
  - optional step, only if you want to use parsley - add in the parsley stalks.
  - optional step, only if you like a teensy bit of spice - add in the chilli flakes (sprinkle as much/little as you like)
7. After 3-4 minutes, scoop up a ladle of pasta water and dump in the pan to make the sauce "creamy" (and avoid burning the herbs). You want the starchy water to bind to the oil.
8. 1 minute till the pasta is done, snatch up the pasta and dump in the pan.
9. Mix the pasta with the sauce - keep stirring and let the pasta finish cooking in the pan.
  - If pasta looks a bit dry, add more pasta water
10. When the pasta is just about done, dump in 90% of the chopped parsley leaves, and turn the stove on high heat and mix the parsley & pasta well.
  - leave some parsley leaves for garnishing
11. Scoop out the pasta, plate it, top up with some of the pasta sauce, sprinkle on some parsley leaves and/or chilli flakes, and serve.
