## Recommended types of pasta
- Spaghettoni (thick spaghetti)

## Ingredients
**Serves:** 

- 300gr Spaghettoni (thick spaghetti)
- 200g - 1cup Pecorino Romano* (grated)
- Pepper - roughly ground
- Rock Salt
- 3L water (12.8cups)

*ou should really only use Pecorino but if you like, you can also use a combination of Parmigiano & Pecorino



## Instructions
### Start by cooking the pasta
1. Boil the water on the stove in a large pot. 
2. When the water comes to boil, add rock salt and let it dissolve.
3. Add the pasta to the boiling water, keeping an eye on the time and cooking the pasta 2-3 minutes less than the desired cooking time.

### Toast the pepper & set up the cream
Next, is the secret to taking your cacio e pepe pasta recipe from good to GREAT! 
4. Put the fry pan on your stove at a medium heat and grind a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper in it - like probably more than you think you need
5. Leave the pepper to lightly toast for a few minutes and grate at least 300g of pecorino cheese into a bowl.
6. Once the pepper has been toasting for a few minutes, use a ladle and scoop out some pasta water, pouring it into the pan where it should bubble up! 

VINCENZO’S PLATE TIP: The water should become a little bit white, which is a perfect sign! This is the starch and will help the pepper (and cheese) to stick to your pasta!

7. Now, add half a ladle of water to your bowl of grated cheese and mix it together using a spoon/fork/spatula to create a *thick* paste. Don’t add too much or it will become runny (If it does, add extra grated pecorino cheese to thicken it up again).
8. Once the pasta has approx. 3 minutes left to cook, using a set of long tongs, get the pasta out and add it to your fry pan. Mix this together really well and add a cup/ladle full of pasta water.
9. If you notice the water drying up, add some more along with more pepper and keep mixing.
10. After mixing this through for 2 minutes, turn the heat off, and add the cheesy paste for the cacio e pepe recipe to the pan.

Now it’s very important to help the cheese melt and dissolve into the water. For the perfect cacio e pepe, there shouldn’t be any stringy or thick pieces of cheese in your pasta.

12. Combine all of this for at least another minute or until all of your cheese is dissolved and a thick creamy sauce coats the pasta.

**Bonus points:** Toss your pan up even gently if you find it hard because it will help to stop the cheese from over cooking and also lather all the strands of pasta even more.
